### Implementing with Cursor

This template is designed to work with the Cursor IDE and its AI agent (composer). To get started:

1. **Run with Cursor Composer**
   - Open Cursor IDE
   - Press `Cmd + I` (Mac) or `Ctrl + I` (Windows/Linux) to open the Cursor Composer
   - Add both `.cursorrules` and `cursor-tasks.md` to the composer context
   - Use the following prompt:
     ```
     Go through each task in the .cursor-tasks file. After you complete each task, 
     update the file to check off any task. Run builds and commits after each task. 
     Continue with each task until you have checked off each one. After each story, 
     do not take a screenshot. If you need more detail about a task, you can gather 
     relevant files and pass the FULL file to the research agent.
     ```

2. **Monitor Progress**
   - The agent will work through each task in order
   - Tasks will be checked off automatically as they're completed
   - Commits will be made after each task
   - You can monitor progress in the cursor-tasks.md file
